The CSV file was generated via manual inspection. The mapping is not perfect because:

(1) ANZICS uses APACHE III-j, whereas eICU uses APACHE IV. The codes slightly differ.
(2) ANZICS invented a small number of diagnoses
(3) ANZICS collapse a few APACHE IV diagnoses into a single diagnosis
(4) ANZICS does not have a valid mapping for a small number of diagnoses

Overall there are only ~10-20 mismatches which we have flagged
